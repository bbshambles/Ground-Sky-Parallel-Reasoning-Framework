This document explains how to adopt the **Ground & Sky Parallel Reasoning Framework** without changing core model weights. It covers the runtime pipeline, merge policy, logging, evaluation, and a safe rollout plan.

---

## 1) Integration Model (No weight changes)

**Ground** = your existing LLM as-is.  
**Sky** = a parallel reasoning pass (can be the same LLM with a different system prompt, or a small helper model).  
**Merge** = a lightweight decision layer (rules-based + optional learned scorer).

[ Prompt ]
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Ground()  # factual pass
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Sky()     # symbolic pass (quarantined)
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Merge(Ground, Sky) ‚Üí Final Output + Logs

- Run Ground and Sky **in parallel** (or Sky only when needed).
- Merge decides: **Accept**, **Dual-present**, or **Reject** Sky.

---

## 2) Minimal API Shape

You can wrap existing endpoints (pseudo-API):

```python
def ground(prompt): ...
def sky(prompt): ...
def merge(ground_out, sky_out, policy): ...
def respond(prompt):
    g = ground(prompt)
    s = sky(prompt)  # quarantine
    final, log = merge(g, s, policy=MERGE_POLICY)
    store(log)
    return final


‚∏ª

3) Merge Policy (starter rules)

Priority order:
	1.	Safety & Legality (block/redirect if risk)
	2.	Factual Reliability (Ground dominates where facts matter)
	3.	Clarity & Usefulness (Sky allowed if it adds value without distorting truth)
	4.	Dual-Presentation when both are valid but incompatible

Example (rules-first, optional ML later):

MERGE_POLICY = {
  "safety_blocks": ["self-harm methods", "illegal advice", "medical misinfo"],
  "ground_domains": ["health", "finance", "law", "safety", "science"],
  "allow_sky_if": [
    "empathy_or_motivation",
    "harmless_metaphor",
    "clearly_labeled_speculation"
  ],
  "dual_present_if": ["mutually_exclusive_but_reasonable"],
  "always_log": True
}


‚∏ª

4) Logging for Audit & Research

Every response gets a merge log:

{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T12:34:56Z",
  "prompt": "...",
  "ground_reason": "...",
  "sky_reason": "...",
  "merge_reason": "why accept/reject/dual-present",
  "final_output": "...",
  "rejected_insights": ["list of quarantined ideas"],
  "safety_priority": "none|low|high"
}

	‚Ä¢	Store logs securely (PII scrubbing if needed).
	‚Ä¢	Use logs for QA review, model tracing, and policy iteration.

‚∏ª

5) Safety Posture
	‚Ä¢	High-risk prompts ‚Üí Ground only; Sky allowed only for supportive, non-harmful affect.
	‚Ä¢	Misinformation ‚Üí Ground‚Äôs factual correction dominates; Sky may explain why people believe it (without validating).
	‚Ä¢	Physics limits ‚Üí Ground sets constraints; Sky may offer labeled metaphor.
	‚Ä¢	Finance/medical ‚Üí Sky never recommends; may add empathy/context.

‚∏ª

6) Evaluation Plan (quick start)

Offline eval:
	‚Ä¢	Re-run Batches 001‚Äì004 and score:
	‚Ä¢	Hallucination rate (‚Üì)
	‚Ä¢	Clarity & usefulness (‚Üë)
	‚Ä¢	Safety incidents (‚Üì)
	‚Ä¢	Reviewer trust (‚Üë)
	‚Ä¢	Tag each case with: accepted_sky, dual_present, or rejected_sky.

Online A/B:
	‚Ä¢	A: Baseline LLM
	‚Ä¢	B: Ground & Sky wrapper
	‚Ä¢	Metrics: user satisfaction, correction requests, safety flags, time-to-answer.

‚∏ª

7) Rollout Strategy
	1.	Pilot: Internal red-teaming + small user cohort (safety domains first).
	2.	Gatekeeping: Start with Ground-only in high-risk; gradually enable Sky for low-risk domains.
	3.	Policy tuning: Iterate MERGE_POLICY from logs + human feedback.
	4.	Scale: Enable dual-presentation where stakeholders benefit from parallel views.

‚∏ª

8) Prompting Templates (starter)

Ground system prompt (concise):

"You are Ground: provide factual, verifiable answers.
Prioritize safety, legality, and reality constraints.
Avoid speculation. Be clear and precise."

Sky system prompt (quarantined):

"You are Sky: generate symbolic, empathetic, or imaginative angles.
No unsafe specifics. Use metaphor where helpful.
Label speculation. Your output may be rejected."

Merge rubric (operator notes):

"If safety risk ‚Üí Ground only.
If factual domain ‚Üí Ground dominates; Sky optional for empathy/metaphor.
If two valid but incompatible views ‚Üí Dual-present, clearly labeled."


‚∏ª

9) Known Limitations & Mitigations
	‚Ä¢	Latency: Two passes cost time ‚Üí run Sky selectively (trigger on ambiguity/emotion).
	‚Ä¢	Cost: Parallel inference ‚Üí cache Ground; reduce Sky length; batch where possible.
	‚Ä¢	Policy drift: Regularly review logs; add tests to Batches.
	‚Ä¢	Over-poetic Sky: Enforce length caps + ‚Äúplain-language fallback‚Äù.

‚∏ª

10) Compliance & Governance
	‚Ä¢	Data handling: scrub PII in logs; apply retention policy.
	‚Ä¢	Red-team reviews: schedule periodic audits of rejected_insights.
	‚Ä¢	Change control: version MERGE_POLICY and attach to each batch release.
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: ensure final outputs remain clear when Sky is included.

‚∏ª

11) Success Criteria (go/no-go)
	‚Ä¢	‚â• 30% reduction in hallucination/unsupported claims on eval set
	‚Ä¢	0 safety regressions in high-risk categories
	‚Ä¢	‚Üë human rater trust and perceived helpfulness
	‚Ä¢	Positive qualitative feedback on dual-presentation cases

‚∏ª

12) What to Open-Source vs. Keep Internal
	‚Ä¢	Open-source: protocol docs, test batches, default prompts, example merge code.
	‚Ä¢	Internal: proprietary safety heuristics, risk classifiers, sensitive logs.

‚∏ª

TL;DR
	‚Ä¢	Wrap your existing LLM with Ground (facts) + Sky (symbolic) passes.
	‚Ä¢	Merge decides what reaches the user, with full audit logs.
	‚Ä¢	Start in safety-critical domains with Ground-only, then expand Sky where it helps.
	‚Ä¢	No model surgery required ‚Äî just thinking before speaking, by Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs add the deployment doc next. This is the one OpenAI reviewers will care about most.
