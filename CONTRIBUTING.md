# 🤝 Contributing to the Ground & Sky Parallel Reasoning Framework

Thank you for your interest in improving **Ground & Sky**.

This framework is designed to be:
- **Safe** — factual reliability always comes first.
- **Transparent** — all decisions and rejections are logged.
- **Creative** — symbolic reasoning is encouraged, but never at the expense of truth.
